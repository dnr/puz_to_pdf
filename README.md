njyoon's fork of Crossword Nexus' puz to pdf converter, hacked on to work in node.

Many .puz files work well, but some require tweaking options (at which point you
might want to use the original at
[https://njyoon.github.io/pdf](https://njyoon.github.io/pdf)).

Usage:

```
./main.js my.puz
```

---

These tools add some additional editing options to Crossword Nexus's [PUZ to PDF Converter](https://crosswordnexus.com/apps/puz-to-pdf/) and [PUZ TO NYT Converter](https://crosswordnexus.com/apps/puz-to-nyt/).
